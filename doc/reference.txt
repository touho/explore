Why unity is bad:
heavy
mouse heavy
no editor for linux
Expensive if you need all features
Using the engine requires you to agree with their policies
Crud GUI, finally about to be replaced though. (2011)
Out of date Mono
GC is a massive pain in the a$$
Working on big games takes ALOT of optimisations. 
Standard networking isnt the greatest.
Terrain engine is a complete joke
